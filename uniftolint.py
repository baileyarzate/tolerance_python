def uniftolint(x, alpha = 0.05, P = 0.99, upper = None, lower = None, side = 1):
    '''
Arguments
    x: A vector of data which is distributed according to a uniform distribution.
    
    alpha: The level chosen such that 1-alpha is the confidence level.
    
    P: The proportion of the population to be covered by this tolerance interval.
    
    upper: The upper bound of the data. When NULL, then the maximum of x is used.
    
    lower: The lower bound of the data. When NULL, then the minimum of x is used.
    
    side: Whether a 1-sided or 2-sided tolerance interval is required (determined by side = 1 or side = 2, respectively).
    
Value
  uniftol.int returns a data frame with items:
        
    alpha: The specified significance level.
    
    P: The proportion of the population covered by this tolerance interval.
    
    1-sided.lower: The 1-sided lower tolerance bound. This is given only if side = 1.
    
    1-sided.upper: The 1-sided upper tolerance bound. This is given only if side = 1.
    
    2-sided.lower: The 2-sided lower tolerance bound. This is given only if side = 2.
    
    2-sided.upper: The 2-sided upper tolerance bound. This is given only if side = 2.
